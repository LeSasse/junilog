Junilog is a small command line utility to collect and aggregate logging information
from [junifer](https://juaml.github.io/junifer/main/index.html) pipelines into 
convenient DataFrames. This DataFrame contains information about ressources used
(CPUs, time elapsed, memory, disk space used ...), warnings, job success etc. Each
row corresponds to a junifer 'element'. For now, it is assumed that logs are
from [HTCondor](https://htcondor.org/) as no other queueing backends are implemented in junifer.

# Install:

Best to set up a virtual environment, for example:

```
python3 -m venv junilogvenv
source junilogvenv/bin/activate
```

Then install it from GitHub:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/LeSasse/junilog.git
```

# Usage

## Get some example logs
Try out the tool in your own junifer pipeline. Alternatively you can use the example
provided in this repository if you have not run a junifer pipeline yet.

```
git clone https://github.com/LeSasse/junilog.git --recurse-submodules
cd junilog/example/aomic-fc/code/junifer_jobs
```

You can then either get the log files using [datalad](https://www.datalad.org/):
```
datalad get PREPROCESS_PIOP1
```
or directly using [git annex](https://git-annex.branchable.com/):
```
git annex get PREPROCESS_PIOP1
```

## Run `junilog`

To get the aggregate DataFrame containing element-wise logging info, run
`junilog` on the directory with your junifer job. In the provided example, run:

```
junilog PREPROCESS_PIOP1 -o element_logs.csv
```
This will create a `csv` with the aggregated logging information. You can
also use the `--ipython` flag, if you have [ipython](https://ipython.org/)
installed. This will start an IPython session with the DataFrame in memory, so you
can start meddling with it straight away.

You can then explore your logs to quickly gain some insights, for example about failed
jobs. To see which subjects failed, and why, you could run in the **ipython console**:

```ipython
out_df.query("return_value == 1")["errors_out_file"]
```
